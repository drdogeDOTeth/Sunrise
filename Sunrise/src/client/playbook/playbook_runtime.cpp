/**
 * The mission playbook. It watches the player's location and fires the roteiro's steps as they are
 * reached, once each per run, announcing the first and the last one differently so the start and
 * the end of a roteiro are distinguishable on screen.
 *
 * A sequential roteiro is a script rather than a set of points: a step waits on the one before it,
 * which is also what lets a step be gated on time instead of place. The run clock those waits are
 * measured against is stamped here, on entering the world, because the game exposes none that serves.
 *
 * Nothing plays a sound yet. A step's audio tag is carried and reported; the emit path is the one
 * piece that does not exist, and this is where it plugs in.
